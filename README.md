# Code Refactor Starter Code

<strong>Title:</strong> Boot Camp Homework 1 - Horiseon Webpage Development

<strong>Description:</strong> The project was to change any HTML and CSS elements to more descriptive tags.

<strong>Purpose:</strong> Changing elements and tags in HTML and CSS to descriptive names using semantic HTML helps increase accessibility.

<strong>Notes:</strong> Because I only worked on the code for accessibility purposes, there are no visual changes to the page.

I learned that using semantic HTML elements and tags really helps not only in Google searches, but also helps those not very experienced with coding find the elements they are looking for. It also helps me to find the elements <strong>I'm</strong> looking for!
